### App Description ###

This app is a portal for incoming students to universities. It allows a user to submit their name, instagram username, and a bio. The admin of the app then has the option to either approve or reject the post. An approval will submit the post to the community Instagram of the incoming class that student belongs to. There, they can meet other incoming students and find potential new roomates.
